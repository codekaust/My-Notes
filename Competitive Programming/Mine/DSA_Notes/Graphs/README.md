Graph is a non-linear data structure where there are >=1 number of nodes connected using edges with no specific rule. TAbateree is a special graph with exactly *n-1 edges* and unique paths from root to every other node.

Formally, graph G is an ordered pair of a set V [vertices] and a set E [edges].

> **G = (V, E)** where V, E are sets.

Note: (...) represent ordered elements [like array], {...} represent unordered set.

So above G = (V, E) was ordered. V = {v1, v2, v3, v4} is ordered (order doesn't matter).  

E = Set of edges of following types **Directed Edges:** e.g. (v1, v2) v1 to v2., **Undirected Edges:** e.g. {v1, v2} or {v2, v1} i.e. link between v1 and v2.

Now, what are **directed and undirected graphs**? -> Ones having directed edges, undirected edges respectively.
